📌 Project Title


Detecting Fake Reviews using Contextual Relational Model


📝 Description
This project aims to detect fake or spam reviews using a Contextual Relational Model (CRM) that leverages both textual and relational data. It analyzes the context of reviews along with relationships among reviewers, products, and review patterns to identify suspicious or fraudulent activities.


🎯 Objective
To build a system capable of identifying fake reviews using machine learning and NLP.
To utilize contextual information and relationship-based patterns between entities (reviewer, product, and review content).
To improve trust in online review systems by filtering out manipulative or misleading reviews


🔍 Features
Preprocessing of raw review data (tokenization, stop-word removal, etc.)
Feature extraction using TF-IDF, contextual embeddings (like BERT), and relational features.
Model training using supervised learning methods.
Graph/network-based analysis for identifying suspicious reviewer behaviors.
Evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data processing
Scikit-learn / XGBoost – Machine learning
NLTK / SpaCy / Transformers (BERT) – NLP tasks
NetworkX – Relational/graph modeling
Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization
🚀 Future Work
Integrate deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for better contextual understanding.
Apply to multilingual review datasets.
Extend to real-time review moderation systems.
